## this  project is considered an ECommerce software project

E-Commerce websites are considered as an online door that facilitate online transactions of goods and services through means of the transfer
of information and funds over the Internet.
In the early days, e-Commerce was done partially through emails and phone calls. Now, with a single website, anything and everything that a 
transaction needs, can be executed online.

### it is a website for a clothing store with two interfaces: 
```
User interface:
           - that will enable the user to view all the products provided by the store and add any of them to the shopping cart,
             as well as the products that were recently added, as well as the offers provided by the store.
           - Search for the products he wants and follow up on his orders in terms of whether they have been approved by the store
             administrators or not yet.If they are approved, their arrival date will be displayed.
```
#### The user can also communicate with administrators if he encounters a problem or wants to suggest something.
```
Admin interface:
          - through which administrators modify the information of any of the existing products, delete it, add it to one of the
            offers, or add a new product.
          - adding offers, and approving orders that have been sent, and viewing the accounts of users who have register on the
            website, as well as the messages that have been sent, and the dashboard to display the number of products available on
            the site, the number of orders that have been completed, and the total profits,as well as the number of admins accounts,
            the number of user accounts, and the number of messages that have been sent.
```
